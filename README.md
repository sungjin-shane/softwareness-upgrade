# Softwareness
> Providing self-awareness to the software industry

I begin to enhance and upgrade our cohort project in dev academy.
Originally, It was our progject that all member involved. It was so exciting and educational project for me.
This is because I could learn the react framework and its process.  
I was responsible for server side authentification and making some components and routes.

After final presentaion, I am considering to pu more useful function and advanced API by myself.
